Specplotbox is just the display for specplot. 

I'm rewriting a version of specplot box that will still call specplot, but will display only one. 

For CHESS, the three boxes can be dropped anywhere in the plot, and the three plots will show the collaped view inside that box. 

For this one, all I care about is collapsing along one of the axes.

Need the rebin factor spinbox as well. 

Data looks about right, just need to actually have the information come through the settings in the plugin.
