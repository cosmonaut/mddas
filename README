MDDAS - Modular Detector Data Acquisition System
-----

MDDAS is a tool to acquire, plot, and save data from photon-counting
detectors in real time.

The subfolder gui contains the core MDDAS application and the plugins
subfolder contains all sampling plugins currently available.

## Requirements

In order to build MDDAS Qt (version 4), Qwt (version >= 6.1), CCFits,
and comedi (for a plugin) are required libraries.

## Building

Use the following commands to build MDDAS and all plugins. To select
only certain plugins edit plugins/plugins.pro and comment out all
unwanted plugins from the SUBDIRS variable.

    qmake
    make

Note that the proper syntax for qmake may be 'qmake-qt4' if you have a
system with both Qt4 and Qt5 installed.

## Installation

## License
